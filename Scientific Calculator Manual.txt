Scientific Calculator ReadMe
----------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Scientific Calculator application!
This program enables to do some numerical evaluations with built-in functions and some enhancements...

- The Calculator has 16 built-in functions, support memory variables, and it's a demoscene of a simple, stack based, algebraic parser.
- The user just need to input from keyboard or from the buttons above, and display the results.

Basic Syntax:
The user can evaluate the following algebraic expressions easilly:
2+4
sqrt(16)*(cos(1)*4)
cos(sin(tan(1)))
....

Using internal registers:
Multiple sentences should be aggregated with the colon ":" symbol
2+5:1+9
- But it will return only the contents of the last sentence, which is "10"

To avoid data loss, it's better to define some variables, and use the "DspVal" to display the results.
- Then change the last example to:
a=2+5:b=1+9
And use the "DspVar" to display the values.

You can add recall on display the current variable contents using the "DspVar=", which will prompt:
a=7,b=10
And add another sentences.

Defining variables and constants:
It is possible to define constants and variables using the adequate keys...
ab1=1 (A constant called "ab1")
ab2?=2 (A variable called "ab2")
You can change variables on runtime, but constants contents will give an error.
a=0:a=a+1 (Error)
a?=0:a=a+1 (OK)
